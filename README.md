This repository provides a signature matrix, named GC10 composed of the characteristic expression profiles for 10 non-immune cell populations in gastric samples. 
This signature matrix distinguished early malignant epithelial cell (EMEC), premalignant epithelial cell (PMEC), enteroendocrine, GMC, goblet cell, MSC, PC, PMC, endothelial cell, and stromal cell populations. 
Marker genes were ranked in decreasing order by their fold changes between one cell pupulation and all other cell populations.
